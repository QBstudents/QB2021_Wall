# Quantitative Biodiversity Course, Spring 2021, Indiana University
## Pat Wall - patgwall@iu.edu
I am pat, I studied biochemistry in undergrad but I didn't like it. I am interested in how biological systems maintain stability and are able to persist despite changing environments. To study these questions I use computation and methods from complex systems in an ecological and evolutionary context. I have a dog named Goji and she is my best friend! I like to ride bikes.

What I want from this course:
1. Learn about methods used in the study of biodiversity
1. Learn more aout concepts related to biodiversity
1. Refresh my R skills (learn ggplot)
